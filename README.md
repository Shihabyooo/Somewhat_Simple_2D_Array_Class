#Somewhat_Simple_2D_Array_Class

A C++ class (Header + .cpp file) defining an Array2D type to work-around C++'s weakness with dynamic matrices/arrays.
Comes with some maths operators overloaded for some basic matrix operations (multiplication, additions, transposing, inversion) plus other helper methods.

Tested with Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows 10-1903.
Note: For some reason, compilation fails in Visual Studio when set to debug mode, but works flawlessly in release mode.
